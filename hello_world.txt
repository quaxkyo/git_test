Hello, world!

Trying to get used to making changes to files locally 
then commiting it to Github using the terminal and Git.
# Trying to use [git add]. I have no idea when to use [git add] and [git commit -m]. LOL
# Before trying it out, I'll guess that add is for single files, and commit -m is for multiple files that needs-- iteration?
# ^ No. So I thought I messed up but it's all good and I did it.

SUMMARY
Commands:
[git clone SSH_link_of_Github_repo] -> copy or "clone" Github repo to local
[git add file] -> used to add the file with changes (first step of commiting in Git)
[git commit -m "some text"] -> second step of commiting
[git push] / [git push origin main] -> commit from local to the remote origin main in Github (update the Github repo for the file)
[git status] -> command to.. check the status of your file/s in Git..? =>
[git log] -> list of all committed changes
